Most of langauge use `if-else`, but don't use `for-else`. But, python assist `for-else`. In `for-else`, `else` is executed when the `for statement` is executed to the end **without being broken by a break in the middle.**

In other language, if you confirm that `for` is excuted without beign broken, you have to use other variable. But in python, you don't have to do that. Here is the example. 

~~~python
data = [9, 42, 11, 30]
is_bigger_that_50 = False
for i in data:
	if i > 50:
		is_bigger_that_50 = True
		break

if is_bigger_that_50 == True:
	print('There is no number bigger than 50')
~~~

~~~python
data = [2, 4, 5, 11, 3]
for i in data:
    if i > 50:
        break
else:
    print('There is no number bigger than 50')
~~~

Those 2 code work samely. You can see the **'There is no number bigger than 50'** in both.

~~~bash
'There is no number bigger than 50'
~~~
