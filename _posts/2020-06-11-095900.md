Remote desktop is very useful to connect other computer. But, sometimes that doesn't work. What have to do in this situation?

1. Settings -> Network & Internet -> Ethernet -> Click Ethernet which you use -> Confirm Network profile is privite 
2. Settings -> System -> Remote Desktop -> Enable Use Remote Desktop
