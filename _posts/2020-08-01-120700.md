There is a situation that we ping other ip, but we cannot find that network. In that situation, confirm this.

- Confirm both subnetmask are same.
- Confirm ip is adjusted. Using **ipconfig** on cmd. If you just modified ip just before, your computer may not have recognized it.
- Confirm network category is private. If you in the public state, windows recognizes that you are in the place with many people.
