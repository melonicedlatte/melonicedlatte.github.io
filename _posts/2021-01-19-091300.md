Sometimes, we use curl. But, there is a error like under.

~~~bash
$ curl -L https://git.io/vddgY | bash

curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.

How can we fix it? If you appened `-k option`, you can download normally. 

~~~bash
$ curl -L https://git.io/vddgY -k | bash
