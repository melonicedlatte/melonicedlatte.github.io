Sometimes or some platforms, if you using uart cable, uart is not work. In teraterm, there is no port to connect. In my case, i see `device manager`. I saw that uart driver **ttl232rg-vreg1v8(or other name)** is not installed. In that time, you have to install driver. 

1. Go to download page and download driver file for your OS. [Download page](https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)
2. Unzip that file.
3. In **device manager**, click right mouse on **ttl232rg-vreg1v8(or other name)**
4. Choose **update driver.** 
5. In menu, pick folder you upziped. That finished.

Maybe you can solve, follwing this step. If uart problem is unsolved until now, go to **device manager** and choose new unknown device. And excute step 4~5.
