Sometimes, we want to know about file's `LBA(Logical Block Address)` in linux. Some program write file based on lba, and we want to know sometime. In that time, you can use under command. We can easily see LBA of file. 

~~~bash
sudo hdparm --fibmap afile 
~~~

The result is as follows. You can easillly get lba of file. 

~~~bash
filesystem blocksize 4096, begins at LBA 0; assuming 512 byte sectors.
byte_offset  begin_LBA    end_LBA    sectors
          0  230284974  230284992         18
