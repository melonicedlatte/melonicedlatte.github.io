When we use `mkdir -p` option, system automatically creates an **intermediate directory that does not exist.** If you use `-p`, you don't need to make intermediate directory. Intermediate directories are created automatically. This is very useful.

~~~bash
# below command is not success because there is no middle directory(f1/f2) 
$ mkdir f1/f2/f3
mkdir: f1/f2: No such file or directory

# below command is success
$ mkdir -p f1/f2/f3
~~~
