`Hybrid Sleep` saves the dram data to ssd when platform go to the S3. They prevent missing of data when platform's battery or power is gone. 

There is a situation that you cannot see **Hybrid Sleep Option** in Power Options. If it exists, you can find "Power Options" > "Sleep" > "Allow Hybrid Sleep" In that time you have to use those command. 

Confirm available power state on platform. 

~~~bash
powercfg /a
~~~

Turn on/off `Hybrid Sleep`.
~~~bash
powercfg -h on
powercfg -h off
~~~
