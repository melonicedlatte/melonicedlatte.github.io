If Jekyll front matter not work and print out in html view, i recommend you have to remake your file.

In my case, I copy `.html` file and just change extension to `.md`.
And after that, jekyll can't not recognize my front matter and print in html.

Make file new and choose extension `.md`. 

And this solution will not work, you have to go [this link stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42351219/jekyll-frontmatter-appearing-on-my-website-and-not-inserting-properly-into-my-de).
